# wave-function-collapse

Playing around with the wave function collapse algorithim. This algorithim uses a tilesett to create new variations of a grid by collapsing possible options down.

## Inspiration

- The coding train made a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) on how wave function collapse is used.  
- There is an infinite amount of tilesets that can be used, but [this](http://www.cr31.co.uk/stagecast/wang/twin.html) website has some really good ones.
